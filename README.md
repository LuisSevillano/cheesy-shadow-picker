# Cheesy shadow picker

A collection of authentic and delightful CSS shadows to use in your maps or web graphics.

Svelte project to list a collection of CSS text-shadow for using them in graphics, maps or pictures.

The shadows have been collected from media like The New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters Graphics, Propublica, Bloomberg or El Pa√≠s. Some of them have been slightly modified to fit the default black/white scheme. This feature is especially useful in combination with [ai2html](ai2html.org) or for highlighting text on any kind of graphic, map or photo.

You can change text color or shadow color, the background or even invert that configuration. Click on a shadow block to copy that shadow to your clipboard.

Feel free to suggest your own shadows via PR to make this collection bigger or make a fork of the project to improve it.
